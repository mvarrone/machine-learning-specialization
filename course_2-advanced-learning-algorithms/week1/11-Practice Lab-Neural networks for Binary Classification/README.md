## Programming Assignment: Practice Lab: Neural Networks for Binary Classification

### Instructions

Welcome to this first assignment of course 2. 

In this exercise:  

- You will use a neural network to recognize the hand-written digits
- You will first learn to build a neural network in a popular machine learning framework, Tensorflow
- You will use your model to do image recognition on a portion of the famous MNIST data set
- You will then learn what is 'under the hood' of these frameworks by implementing the forward path of the same network in NumPy in your own mini-framework
