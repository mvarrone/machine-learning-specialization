## [IMPORTANT] Reminder about end of access to Lab Notebooks

Hi learner! 

The next item(s) is/are the final graded item(s) of this course. If you pass it/them and have also passed all previous graded items, you will be able to get the course certificate. Congratulations!

**Please note** that, as per [Courseraâ€™s Payment and Refund Policy](https://www.coursera.org/about/terms#payments-and-refund-policy), **your access to graded items (as well as Ungraded Labs hosted on Coursera) will end** once your subscription expires. If you want to keep your lab notebooks for reference, we highly recommend that you [download them](https://community.deeplearning.ai/t/downloading-your-notebook-downloading-your-workspace-and-refreshing-your-workspace/475495) **before you complete the course or Specialization.** 

You can reach out to the [Coursera Learner Help Center](https://www.coursera.support/s/article/360036160591-How-to-contact-Coursera?language=en_US) if you have questions about this policy, or if you get locked while having an active subscription. 

Thank you and keep learning!
