## Brief information about Arthur Samuel

- Arthur Lee Samuel (December 5, 1901 â€“ July 29, 1990) was an American pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence. He popularized the term "machine learning" in 1959. 

- The Samuel Checkers-playing Program was among the world's first successful self-learning programs, and as such a very early demonstration of the fundamental concept of artificial intelligence (AI).

- He was also a senior member in the TeX community who devoted much time giving personal attention to the needs of users and wrote an early TeX manual in 1983.

- Samuel's claim to fame was that back in the 1950s: He wrote a checkers playing program. 

- The amazing thing about this program was that Arthur Samuel himself wasn't a very good checkers player. What he did was he had programmed the computer to play maybe tens of thousands of games against itself. 

- And by watching what social support positions tend to lead to wins and what positions tend to lead to losses the checkers plane program learned over time what are good or bad suport position.

- By trying to get a good and avoid bad positions, this program learned to get better and better at playing checkers.

- Because the computer had the patience to play tens of thousands of games against itself it was able to get so much checkers playing experience that eventually it became a better checkers player than also Samuel himself.

## Machine Learning algorithms

1) Supervised learning
    - It is the type of ML that is used most in many real-world applications and has seen the most rapid advancements and innovation.
    - 1st and 2nd courses in this specialization focus in this type
2) Unsupervised learning
    - 3rd course in this specialization focus in this type

3) Recommender systems
    - Widely used nowadays

4) Reinforcement learning

## Important advice by the instructor

> The other thing we are going to spend a lot of time on in this specialization is practical advice for applying learning algorithms.
This is something I feel pretty strongly about. Teaching about learning algorithms is like giving someone a set of tools and equally important, so even more important to making sure you have great tools is making sure you know how to apply them because like is it is somewhere where it gives you a state-of-the-art hammer or a state-of-the-art hand drill and say good luck: Now you have all the tools you need to build a three-story house. It doesn't really work like that. And so too, in machine learning, making sure you have the tools is really important and so is making sure that you know how to apply the tools of machine learning effectively. So, that's what you get in this class, the tools as well as the skills to apply them effectively.

## 1. Supervised Learning

Machine learning is creating tremendous economic value today. I think 99 percent of the economic value created by machine learning today is through one type of machine learning, which is called supervised learning.

- Supervised machine learning or more commonly, supervised learning, refers to algorithms that learn x to y or input to output mappings. 

- The key characteristic of supervised learning is that you give your learning algorithm examples to learn from

- That includes the right answers, whereby right answer, I mean, the correct label y for a given input x, and is by seeing correct pairs of input x and desired output label y that the learning algorithm eventually learns to take just the input alone without the output label and gives a reasonably accurate prediction or guess of the output

## 1.1 Regression

- It is a particular type of Supervised Learning in which we try to predict a number from infinitely many possible numbers, such as house prices for example.
- It is about learning input, output, or x to y mappings.

## 1.2 Classification
- In this type of SL, we are trying to predict only a small number of possible outputs or categories. Example: We could try to classify as a benign or malignant tumor in case we are dealing with Breast Cancer
- Terms *class* and *category* are used interchangeably when referring to output
- So, to summarize classification algorithms predict categories. Categories don't have to be numbers. It could be non numeric: 
    - For example:
        - It can predict whether a picture is that of a cat or a dog
        - It can predict if a tumor is benign or malignant. 
        - Categories can also be numbers like 0, 1 or 0, 1, 2.
- What makes classification different from regression when you're interpreting the numbers is that classification predicts a small finite limited set of possible output categories such as 0, 1 and 2 but not all possible numbers in between like 0.5 or 1.7.
-  You can also use more than one input value to predict an output: For example, instead of just knowing the tumor size, say you also have each patient's age in years, thickness of the tumor clump, uniformity of the cell size, uniformity of the cell shape and so on.

## Recap
- Supervised Learning maps input x to output y, where the learning algorithm learns from the quote right answers. 
- The two major types of supervised learning are regression and classification. 

    - In a **Regression** application like predicting prices of houses, the learning algorithm has to predict numbers from infinitely many possible output numbers.
    - Whereas in **Classification** the learning algorithm has to make a prediction of a category, all of a small set of possible outputs.

Question:

Supervised learning is when we give our learning algorithm the right answer y  for each example to learn from.  Which is an example of supervised learning?

Answer: Spam filtering.

For instance, emails labeled as "spam" or "not spam" are examples used for training a supervised learning algorithm. The trained algorithm will then be able to predict with some degree of accuracy whether an unseen email is spam or not.
