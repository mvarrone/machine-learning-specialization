# Optional Lab 7b-max norm-FScaling and alpha

## Instructions

- In this optional lab you can:

    - Take a look at how Feature scaling is done in code
    - Also, see how different choices of the learning rate alpha  $\alpha$ can lead to better or worse training of your model  
    
This will help you to gain a deeper intuition about Feature scaling as well as the learning rate alpha $\alpha$
