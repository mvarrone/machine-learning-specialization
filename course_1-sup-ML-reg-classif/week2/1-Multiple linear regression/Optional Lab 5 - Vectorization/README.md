# Optional lab: Python, NumPy and vectorization

## Instructions

- This optional lab will show you how to use NumPy to implement the math operations of creating vectors and matrices, and performing dot products and matrix multiplications in code. These NumPy operations use vectorization behind the scenes to make the code run faster!

- This optional lab introduces a fair amount of new NumPy syntax
