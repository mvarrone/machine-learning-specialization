# Optional lab 6: Multiple linear regression

## Instructions

- In this optional lab, you will see:
    - How to define a multiple regression model, in code
    - Also how to calculate the prediction, f of x.  
    - Also how to calculate the cost and implement gradient descent for a multiple linear regression model.

- This lab will be using Pythonâ€™s Numpy library, so if any of the code looks very new, please take a look at the previous optional lab that introduces Numpy and Vectorization for a refresher of Numpy functions and how to implement those in code.
