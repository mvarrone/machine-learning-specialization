## Week 2: Regression with multiple input variables

This week you will

- Extend Linear Regression to handle multiple input features. 
- Learn some methods for improving your model's training and performance, such as:
    - Vectorization
    - Feature scaling
    - Feature engineering
    - Polynomial regression. 

At the end of the week, you'll get to practice implementing linear regression in code.

## Learning Objectives

* Use vectorization to implement Multiple Linear Regression
* Use Feature Scaling, Feature Engineering, and Polynomial Regression to improve model training
* Implement Linear Regression in code
