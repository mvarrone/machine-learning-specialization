# Optional lab: Cost function

## Instructions

- This optional lab will show you how the cost function is implemented in code and given a small training set and different choices for the parameters youâ€™ll be able to see how the cost varies depending on how well the model fits the data. 

- In the optional lab, you'll also get to play with an interactive contour plot: You can use your mouse cursor to click anywhere on the contour plot and you see the straight line defined by the values you chose, for parameters w and b.

- Finally the optional lab also has a 3d surface plot that you can manually rotate and spin around, using your mouse cursor, to take a better look at what the cost function looks like.
