## Introduction

## Concept
- It is the science of getting computers to learn without being explicitly programmed.
- Machine Learning (ML) had grown up as a sub-field of AI (Artificial Intelligence)

# Real world applications
- Web search on Google, Bing or Baidu to find out some information
- Tagging people on social media by recognizing them in pictures and labelling them
- Recommendation systems on streaming services to recommnend films/series based on similar topics
- Use of voice to text on phones to write a message
- Spam filtering on emails
- Healthcare industry: helping doctors make accurate diagnosis
- Climate change: ML is already hoping to optimize wind turbine power generation
- Computer vision: Helping to inspect if some product is coming off the assembly line with any defects into factories

## Looking into the future
- There is a huge excitement about the AI dream of someday building machines as intelligent as people. This is sometimes called Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). It could take a long time to get there.
- Mostly AI researchers believe that the best way to get closer toward that goal is by using learning algorithms
- According to a study by McKinsey, AI and Machine Learning is estimated to create an additional 13 trillion US dollars of value annually by the year 2030.
- Instructor believes there is even vastly greater value that has yet to be created outside the software industry in sectors such as retail, travel, transportation, automotive, materials manufacturing, and so on.
