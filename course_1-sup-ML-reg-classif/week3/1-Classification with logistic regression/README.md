## Motivations

Last week you learned about Linear Regression, which predicts a number. 

This week, you will learn about Classification where the output variable *y* can take on only one of a small handful of possible values instead of any number in an infinite range of numbers. It turns out that Linear Regression is not a good algorithm for classification problems.

The type of classification problems where there are only 2 possible outputs is called binary classification where the word **binary** refers to there being only 2 possible classes/categories. 

In these problems I will use the terms *class* and *category* relatively interchangeably. They mean basically the same thing. By convention we can refer to these two classes or categories in a few common ways. 

We often designate clauses as *no* or *yes* or sometimes equivalently *false* or *true* or very commonly using the numbers 0 or 1 following the common convention in Computer Science with 0 denoting false and 1 denoting true. 

One of the terminologies commonly used is to call the false or 0 class the negative class and the true or the 1 class, the positive class. 

For example, for spam classification, an email that is not spam may be referred to as a negative example because the output to the question of "Is this email a spam?" the output is no or 0.

In contrast, an email that has spam might be referred to as a positive training example because the answer to is it spam is yes or true or 1. 

To be clear, negative and positive. Do not necessarily mean bad vs good or evil vs good. It's just that negative and positive examples are used to convey the concepts of absence or zero or false vs the presence or true or one of something you might be looking for. 

Logistic Regression is an algorithm where the output value of the outcome will always be between 0 and 1. 

By the way, one thing confusing about the name Logistic Regression is that even though it has the word of Regression in it is actually used for Classification problems. Don't be confused by the name which was given for historical reasons. It's actually used to solve binary classification problems with output label *y* is either 0 or 1.
