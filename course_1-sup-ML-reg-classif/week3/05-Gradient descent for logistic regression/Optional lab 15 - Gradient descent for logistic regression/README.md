## Optional lab 15 - Gradient descent for logistic regression

## Instructions

In this optional lab, you’ll take a look how the gradient for logistic cost is calculated in code.  This will be useful to look at because you will implement this in the practice lab at the end of the week.

After you run gradient descent in the lab, there will be a nice set of animated plots that show gradient descent in action. You’ll see the sigmoid function, the contour plot of the cost, the 3D surface plot of the cost, and the learning curve all evolve as gradient descent runs.
