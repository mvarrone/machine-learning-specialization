## Optional lab 10: Classification

## Instructions

In this optional lab, you will

- Get to take a look at what happens when you try to use Linear Regression for Classification on categorical data
- See an interactive plot that attempts to classify between two categories

Also, you may notice that this does not work very well, which is okay, because that motivates the need for a different model to do classification tasks
