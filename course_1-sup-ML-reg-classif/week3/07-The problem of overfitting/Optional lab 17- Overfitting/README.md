## Optional lab 17 - Overfitting

## Instructions

In this optional lab, you will 

- take a look at some examples of overfitting that you can adjust by clicking on the options in the plot. 
- be able to add your own data points by clicking on the plot and see how that changes the fitted curve.

Also, you can try examples for both regression and classification. You can also change the degree of the polynomial to see how the curve either overfits or underfits the data
