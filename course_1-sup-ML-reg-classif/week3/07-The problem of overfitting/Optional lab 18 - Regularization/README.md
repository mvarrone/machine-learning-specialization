## Optional lab 18: Regularization

## Instructions

In this final optional lab of week 3, youâ€™ll revisit overfitting, and in this interactive plot, you can now choose to regularize your models, both regression and classification, by enabling regularization during gradient descent by selecting a value for lambda.

Please take a look at the code for implementing regularized logistic regression in particular, because you will implement this in the practice lab at the end of this week.
