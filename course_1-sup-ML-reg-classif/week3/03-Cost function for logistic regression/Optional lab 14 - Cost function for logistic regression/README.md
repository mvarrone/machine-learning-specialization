## Optional lab 14: Cost function for logistic regression

## Instructions

This optional lab:

- will show you how the logistic cost function is implemented in code.

- Also, you will get to implement this later in the practice lab at the end of the week.

This optional lab also shows you how 2 different choices of the parameters will lead to different cost calculations. So you can see in a plot that the better fitting decision boundary has a lower cost relative to another choice for a decision boundary.
