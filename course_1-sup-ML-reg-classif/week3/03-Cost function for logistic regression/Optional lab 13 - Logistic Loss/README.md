## Optional lab 13: Logistic Loss

## Instructions

In this optional lab:

- You will get to take a look at how the squared error cost doesnâ€™t work very well for classification because you will see a surface plot of a very wiggly cost surface with many local minima.

- Then, you will get to take a look at the new logistic loss function, and see that this produces a nice and smooth surface plot that does not have several local minima, plateaus or discontinuities which makes it well suited for gradient descent.
