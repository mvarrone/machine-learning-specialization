## Week 3: Classification

This week you will 

- Learn the other type of supervised learning: Classification. 
- Learn how to predict categories using the Logistic Regression model. 
- Learn about the problem of overfitting, and how to handle this problem with a method called Regularization.
- Get to practice implementing Logistic Regression with Regularization at the end of this week!

## Learning Objectives

* Use Logistic Regression for binary classification
* Implement Logistic Regression for binary classification
* Address overfitting using Regularization to improve model performance
