## Reinforcement Learning

### Instructions

In the final graded practice lab of this course (and this specialization), you'll implement code for a virtual lunar lander. 

This will give you a chance to practice some of the concepts in deep reinforcement learning covered in lecture.  

At the end of the lab, you'll see a video of your lunar lander and can check whether it has learned to successfully land on the moon's surface!
